This paper presents an approach for the estimation of uncertain linear positive systems, based on interval observers. The provided conditions for the existence of robust interval positive observers are expressed in terms of LP. Also, it is shown that the design of tight interval positive observers can be done by minimizing an adequate bound on the steady state of the interval error. An illustrative example is given."

More precisely, cooperative models are considered, i.e., models that satisfy some constraints on the signs of the entries of the Jacobian of their dynamic equation. In this context, interval observers and a guaranteed recursive state estimation algorithm are combined to enclose the state at any given instant of time in a subpaving. The approach is illustrated on the state estimation of a waste-water treatment process.},

These observers are an extension of the open loop asymptotic observers (observers with unknown inputs) devoted to biotechnological systems for which some parts of the model are unknown. We take benefit of the additional outputs which are (nonlinear) functions of the state to design a closed loop observer. The global convergence of these nonlinear observers is proven. We use these observers to design interval based observers which predict guaranteed intervals in which the state is lying. We run simultaneously a broad set of interval observers and we select the best ones. The method is illustrated with a model describing the bioconversion of a substrate using micro-organisms in a bioreactor."
